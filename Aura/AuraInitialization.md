## AURA INITIALIZATION WITH BGFX 
#CMAKE #CPP #OpenGL #VULKAN

Initializate CMake with basic configuration for a executable version, compiler to your election and name as well. 

IN CMakeLists.txt delete rows: 

```cpp
	# include(CTest)
	# enable_testing()


	# set(CPACK_PROJECT_NAME ${PROJECT_NAME})
	# set(CPACK_PROJECT_VERSION ${PROJECT_VERSION})
	# include(CPack)
```

to add git submodules for bgfx we are going to add them as submodules. 
For that you can create a directory to store the submods and just call it ./submods or group all in a folder to include all the external code that is going to be imported into the project.


```cpp
	mkdir external/
	mkdir external/submods
```

To add the three gits necessary for the bgfx project: 
*	git submodule add https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx.git ./external/submods/bgfx
*	git submodule add https://github.com/bkaradzic/bimg.git ./external/submods/bimg
* 	git submodule add https://github.com/bkaradzic/bx.git ./external/submods/bx


For compiling **bgfx** for different platforms, you need to execute the "MakeFile" file specifying the current platform to build for. 
This file is executed by executing the "make" command in the directory. 

```bash
	cd ./external/submods/bgfx/
	make 
```

After calling make, .build/projects/* directory will be generated. All intermediate files generated by compiler will be inside .build directory structure. Deleting .build directory at any time is safe.

make \<configuration\>
Configuration is \<platform\>-\<debug/release\>\[32/64\]. For example:

	linux-release64, wasm-debug, wasm-release, osx-debug, osx-release, android-arm64-release
