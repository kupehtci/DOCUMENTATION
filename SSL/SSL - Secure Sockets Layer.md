# Secure Sockets Layer

Secure Sockets Layer or SSL is a cryptographic protocol designed to secure communication over the network, between a client (Web browser) and a server. 

SSL secures that the data between the two parties is encrypted, private and maintain data integrity. 

It has been succeded by TLS or Transport Layer Security [^1]

It offers: 
- **Encryption**: Protects the data in transit by encrypting it, making it unreadable to unauthorized parties.
- **Authentication**: Ensures that the communicating parties are who they claim to be through the use of SSL certificates.
- **Data Integrity**: Verifies that the transmitted data has not been altered during transit.
