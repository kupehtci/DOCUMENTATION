# SMTP 

Is an <span style="color:LightSeaGreen;">Application layer</span> protocol built over a persistent TCP connection(make a handshake before).
It handles a <span style="color:orange;">client - server</span> using a <span style="color:violet;">command-response pattern</span> with status codes (Similar to HTTP). 

Uses <span style="color:LightSeaGreen;">plain text ASCII</span> messages in its communication: 
* **Commands**: following specific order and some parameters
* **Responses**: Human readable phrase and numeric code response. 

Its a <span style="color:LightSeaGreen;">push protocol</span> meant to push files into the server. In order to retreive and manage the emails from MTA we need a pulling protocol like [[POP3]] or [[IMAP]]. 
#### SMTP Commands

Plain ASCII text used for commands and its parameters.

### BEHAVIOUR

Firstly in order, to establish an SMTP connection, it needs a TCP connection between client and server: 

1. Starts a TCP connection over port 25. 
2. Server answers using TCP socket with a **220 Ready** message. 
3. Client sends a **HELO** command
4. Server answers with **250 Hello, \<sender\>
5. Now transfer of messages starts

1. <span style="color:#7d90b0;">MAIL FROM: &ltsender&gt</span> command is sent by client
2. Server answers <span style="color:#7d90b0;">250 &ltsender&gt Sender OK</span>
3. <span style="color:#7d90b0;">RCPT TO: &ltsender&gt</span> command is sent by the client

### DATA FORMAT

Data in a basic SMTP email is just ASCII message being simple and limited. In order to expand the number of characters available in a message, [[MIME]]  is used and defined for different parts of the email in order to be able to send special media.
