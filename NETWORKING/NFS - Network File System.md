# NFS Network File System

<span style="color:DodgerBlue;">NFS or Network File System</span> is a distributed file system protocol that allows to share directories over the network and mount the remotes directories on your system. 

This allows to work with remote machines as it were local files. 

By default NFS system is not encrypted and has no user authentication, it can only be restricted by client's IP or hostnames. 


When mounting and creating an NFS you must allow in firewall settings the IP's traffic. The common ports used are 111 and 2049.
