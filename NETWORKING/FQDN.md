An <span style="color:DodgerBlue;">FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)</span> is the complete domain name of a specific computer or host on the internet. It includes both the hostname and the domain name. An FQDN provides the exact location within the DNS hierarchy.

FQDN are unique within the whole internet or internal private network. 

For example, in `www.test.example.com`:

- `test` is the hostname.
- `example.com` is the domain name.


Together, `www.test.example.com` forms the FQDN, which uniquely identifies that specific host on the internet.
