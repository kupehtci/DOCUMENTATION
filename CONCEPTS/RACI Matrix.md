# RACI Matrix

A RACI matrix is a **project management tool** used to clarify the responsibilities for each task by assigning 4 different roles over it: 

* **(R) - Responsible**: person or people who do the work to complete the task. 
* **(A) - Accountable**: answerable about the task's outcome and approves the work. 
* **(C) - Consulted**: people that is asked before and during the task. 
* **(I) - Informed**: people who must be kept updated about the task's progress and decisions maked. 

Normally the matrix has columns per each role and rows per each tasks, fulfilling each cell with the person in charge of the role, like for example: 

| Tasks  | R       | A       | C       | I   |
| ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | --- |
| Task 1 | Person1 | Person2 | Person3 | ... |
| Task 2 | ...     | ...     | ...     | ... |
