#CONCEPTS 

SDK or Software Development Kit is a collection of software development tools packaged that provide developers with necessary software for building applications for an specific platform, operating system or programming language. 

It should cover the develop, test and deployment phases of the development. 

An SDK includes:
* **Code, Libraries and APIs**: reusable functions and interfaces that should implement already-made functionality. 
* **Compilers and Debuggers**: tools to build and execute the code. 
* Optionally **documentation** and tutorials
* **Development environments**: or IDEs for writing, testing and debugging code.
