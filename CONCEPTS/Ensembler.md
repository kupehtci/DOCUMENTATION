Computers are only capable of understand a certain set of instructions called as  ISA (Instruction Set Architecture). 

These instructions and information is stored in binary digits (0, 1) and a combination of them form the data that we are used to work with. The codification using 0's and 1's is called machine language. 

Depending on the architecture of the CPU, it offers a certain set of instructions: 

In assembler language, all the movements
