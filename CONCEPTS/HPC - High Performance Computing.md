# High Performance Computing

**High Performance Computing** or **HPC** its related to the practice of using supercomputers or clusters of servers to solve computational problems. 

This requires massive processing power, high memory and fast networking. 

The main characteristics of an HPC cluster are: 
* **Parallel computing**: tasks are broken into smaller pieces to run in multiple nodes
* **High-throughput and low-latency**: requires fast communication between the cluster nodes and network latency and bandwidth are critital
* **Compute intensive**: normally involves simulation, modeling, analysis, genomics, AI training, so CPU power is critical. 
* **High performance storage**: its normal to work with large datasets so the usage of parallel file systems like Lustre is recommended.
