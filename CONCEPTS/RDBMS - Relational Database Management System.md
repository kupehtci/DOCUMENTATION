# RDBMS or Relational Database Management System

A Relational Database Management System or a RDBMS is a type of database Management systems that organizees the data into tables, and mainly used with SQL technologies. It maintains the relationships between the data by using the primary keys  

The key features are: 

* Structured Data Model: Data is stored in predefined tables, where each column represents a specific attribute, and each row represents a record.
* ACID[^1] Properties: RDBMSs are designed to follow the ACID principles (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to ensure reliable transactions.
* Normalization: RDBMSs promote reducing redundancy by structuring data into normalized tables.
* SQL technologies: Most RDBMSs use SQL to perform CRUD[^2] (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database. It allows users to define, manipulate, and query structured data.

[^1]: ACID or Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability are properties that a database is recommended to have and need to meet the four ones in order to be considered as an ACID database technology. [[ACID]] 
[^2]: CRUD is a set of operations  that can be performed over a Database (Create, Read, Update and Delete)[[CRUD - Create, Read, Update and Delete]]
