# Serverless

A <span style="color:DodgerBlue;">serverless cloud solution</span> is a cloud computing model in which the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and scaling of computing resources, allowing developers to build and run applications without the need to manage servers or the infrastructure. 

<span style="color:DodgerBlue;">Serverless</span> doesn't mean there are no servers involved; it simply means that the management of these servers is abstracted from the user. 

The main characteristics of a serverless solution is: 

1. No server management required for the client / developers
2. Automatic scaling to the resources needed of the application
3. Mostly for event-driven solutions[^1]
4. Pay per execution or resources used. 
5. Oriented to microservices, not monolit applications [^mcr]

### Benefits of Serverless Solutions:

- **Cost Efficiency**: You only pay for what you use. When your application isnâ€™t running or receiving requests, you incur no charges.
- **Faster Development**: Developers can focus on writing code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
- **Scalability**: Serverless applications automatically scale with user demand.
- **Simplified Operations**: Serverless abstracts away infrastructure concerns, reducing the burden on operations teams.

### Examples of Serverless Solutions:

- **AWS Lambda**[^2]: Automatically runs your code in response to events.
- **Google Cloud Functions**: Executes single-purpose functions in response to cloud events.
- **Azure Functions**: Enables event-driven programming in a serverless environment.
- **Google Cloud Run**[^3]: Runs containerized applications in a serverless environment.

In essence, serverless cloud solutions enable developers to focus on building and deploying applications, while the cloud provider handles infrastructure, scaling, and resource management.



[^1]: Event-driven programming is when code is initiated by an event that happens, normally out of the server that executes the code[[Event-driven programming]]
[^mcr]: Microservices versus monolith applications [[Monolith versus Microservices]]
[^2]: AWS Lambda is the Amazon serverless service by default [[AWS - Lambda]] [[AWS - Serverless]]. 
[^3]: Google Cloud Run is a serverless service offered by Google Cloud [[GCP - Serverless]]
