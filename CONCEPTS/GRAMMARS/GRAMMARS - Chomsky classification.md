## CHOMSKY Classification of grammar

According to <span style="color:orange;">Noam Chomsky</span>, there are four types of grammars. The following table gathers their differences from each other: 

|Grammar Type|Grammar Accepted|Language Accepted|Automaton|
|---|---|---|---|
|Type 0|Unrestricted grammar|Recursively enumerable language|Turing Machine|
|Type 1|Context-sensitive grammar|Context-sensitive language|Linear-bounded automaton|
|Type 2|Context-free grammar|Context-free language|Pushdown automaton|
|Type 3|Regular grammar|Regular language|Finite state automaton|

| Grammar type | Production Rules |
|---|---|
|Type 0|No restriction |
|Type 1|xAy ::= xvy with A non-terminal with a replacement with terminal but one not empty. A can be replaced with v if its surrounded by `a` and `b` . Follow  <span style="color:orange;">no decrement property</span> |
|Type 2|A ::= v with A non-terminal and v a string of terminal and non-terminal |
|Type 3|A ::= aB or A::= a. non-terminal can be replaced with a terminal that can be followed by a non-terminal |

* <span style="color:orange;">no decrement property</span> the right part is bigger or equal to the left side, except axiom S. 

### TYPE 0 GRAMMAR

**Type-0 grammars** generate recursively enumerable languages. 
The productions have no restrictions. 

They generate the languages that are recognized by a Turing machine.

In the form of **α → β** where: 
* ***α** is a string of terminals and nonterminals with at least one non-terminal and **α** cannot be null. 
* ***β** is a string of terminals and non-terminals.

### Example

P = {
	S → ACaB 
	Bc → acB 
	CB → DB 
	aD → Db
}
### TYPE 1 GRAMMAR

**Type-1 grammars** generate context-sensitive languages. 

The productions must be in the form **αAβ → αγβ** where: 

* ***A ∈ N** (Non-terminal)
* ***α, β, γ ∈ (T ∪ N)*** (Strings of terminals and non-terminals)

The strings **α** and **β** may be empty, but **γ** must be non-empty.

This allows to exchange A with γ if is surrounded by $a$ on left side and $b$ on right side. 

The rule **S → ε** is allowed if S does not appear on the right side of any rule. The languages generated by these grammars are recognized by a linear bounded automaton.

### Example

P = {
	AB → AbBc 
	A → bcA 
	B → b
}
### TYPE 2 GRAMMAR

Type 2 grammars generate regular languages. Context-free grammars. 

The productions must be in the form **A → γ** where **A ∈ N** (Non terminal) and **γ ∈ (T ∪ N)*** (String of terminals and non-terminals).

Needs to have only one non-terminal symbol on the left side. 

These languages generated by these grammars are be recognized by a non-deterministic pushdown automaton.

### Example
P = {
	S → X a 
	X → a
	X → aX
	X → abc
	X → ε
}

### TYPE 3 GRAMMAR 

The type 3 grammars generate natural languages.

This ones need to have a single non-terminal on the left hand side and a right side with single terminal or single terminal followed by a single non-terminal. 

The productions must be in the form **X → a or X → aY** where **X, Y ∈ N** (Non terminal) and **a ∈ T** (Terminal)

A direct replacement of non-terminal with a terminal optionally accompanied by a non-terminal

The rule **S → ε** is allowed if **S** does not appear on the right side of any rule.

### Example

X → ε 
X → a | aY
Y → b
