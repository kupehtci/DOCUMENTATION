## Language generated by a grammar

A set of strings that can be <span style="color:#db7093;">derivated</span> from a certain grammar is its language. 

The language generated by a grammar <span style="color:#abf5f5;">G</span> is a subset formally defined by: 

> $L(G)= \{W | W ∈ ∑^*, S ⇒ G W\}$


## Language construction

If considering the following grammar: 

>G: N = {S, A, B} T = {a, b} P = {S ⇒ AB, A ⇒ aA|a, B ⇒ bB|b}

The accepted strips can be:
* ab
* abb
* aab
* aabb
So the language is:    $L(G) = \{a^m b^n | m ≥ 1\ and\ n ≥ 1\}$

## Grammars equivalency

Two grammars $G_0$ and $G_1$ are equivalent if both represents the same language. 

<span style="color:orange;">ontology</span>: given a linear grammar by the right, exist a linear grammar by the left equivalent and viceversa (Type 3).

Example: 

$G_a$ =( {0, 1} ,{A, B}, A,{A ::= B1 | 1,B ::= A0}) 
$G_b$ =( {0, 1} ,{A, B}, A,{A ::= 1B | 1,B ::= 0A})


## Transform direction of linearity

The linearity can be from the right or from the left. 

To transform from one to another, can be done following this steps: 

* Build a grammar non-recursive with the axiom

For doing this, add a new symbol. 
If add a new rule, B ::= x for each rule S ::= x equivalent. So if S ::= A1 --> B ::= A1. 
And replace S axiom in the right part of the production rules with the new rule.

* Build a graph from the grammar

Number of nodes --> $num\_nodes = C(∑_N)+1$ with each node labeled with $∑_N$ symbols and another with λ for a terminal only replacement.

* Exchange labels and build a new graph

Exchange S and λ labels and invert lines direction. Generate new rules following the graph.

Then with the graph build the grammar
