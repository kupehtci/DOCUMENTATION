## Language generated by a grammar

A set of strings that can be <span style="color:#db7093;">derivated</span> from a certain grammar is its language. 

The language generated by a grammar <span style="color:#abf5f5;">G</span> is a subset formally defined by: 

> $L(G)= \{W | W ∈ ∑^*, S ⇒ G W\}$


## Language construction

If considering the following grammar: 

>G: N = {S, A, B} T = {a, b} P = {S ⇒ AB, A ⇒ aA|a, B ⇒ bB|b}

The accepted strips can be:
* ab
* abb
* aab
* aabb
So the language is:    $L(G) = \{a^m b^n | m ≥ 1 and n ≥ 1\}$
