### LINE FEED CHARACTER

**Linefeed** means to advance downward to the next line; however, it has been repurposed and renamed. Used as "newline", it _terminates_ lines (commonly confused with _separating_ lines). 
This is commonly escaped as:

```
	Character = "\n"
	Display as = abbreviated LF or NL
	ASCII = 10 (0xA)
	CRLF (but not CRNL) is used for the pair "\r\n".
```

### FORM FEED CHARACTER

**Form feed** means advance downward to the next "page". 
It was commonly used as page separators, but now is also used as section separators. Text editors can use this character when you "insert a page break". T
his is commonly escaped as: 

```
	Character = "\f"
	Display as = FF
	ASCII = 12 (0xC)
```
