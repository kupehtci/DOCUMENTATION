# SSOT or Single Source of Truth 

Single Source of Truth is a concept used in software and process design to ensure that a piece of information or an application has a single authoritative place(Truth) where is defined and maintained (Single source). 

Its not only tied to development source code, as alto SSOT takes the form of a **central database** or a **warehouse** that aggregates and normalizes data from multiple sources into a central source.

It is meant to resolve the problem of making decisions based on different and contradictory data sets. With SSOT all the decisions and operations are based on the same dataset improving quality, reducing errores and avoid wasting time reconciling different information. 

Also in Software Architecture is used in **design** to maintain consistency in designing components of UI and styling so are defined once and reused everywhere.
