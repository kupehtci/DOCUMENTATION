# Memoize

**Memoize** is a technique based in storing the results of expensive calculations in an application so you can reuse them later instead of recalculate the same thing over and over again. 

Normally memoize techniques pre-calculate some values so in case that has been previously calculated for those values, uses the cached or if its not stored re-calculate it and stores the result. 

it trades a little bit of memory (For storing the results) for a massive time saving in calculations.
