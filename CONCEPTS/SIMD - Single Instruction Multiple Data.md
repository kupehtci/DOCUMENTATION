#CONCEPTS 
## DEFINITION 

provides hardware support for performing an operation on multiple pieces of data, in parallel, using a single instruction. SIMD operations can be parallelized at the hardware level. That increases the throughput of the vectorized computations, which are common in mathematical, scientific, and graphics apps.
