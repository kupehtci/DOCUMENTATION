### OCTAL TREE

## Search Tree

A **search tree** is a <span style="color:orange;">tree data structure</span> used for locating specific keys contained in a set. 
In order for a tree to function as a search tree, the key for each node must be greater than any keys in subtrees on the left, and less than any keys in subtrees on the right.

If the search tree is ordered this way, can be use for searching items.
