#CONCEPTS 

A computer is a machine designed to process information and data and use a single representation <span style="color:#ab0505;">binary</span>. 

And because we have various types of data so we need to make use of <span style="color:#db7093;">representation</span> for transforming this types of data into binary and inverted. 


take into account __the finite set__ of values: 

* BInary format 
* With n bits we can get $2^n$ distinct values. 

So data is limited, for example, the color depth limited with 8 bits to 256 colors. 


### POSITIONAL REPRESENTATION SYSTEMS 

A number is defined as a <span style="color:#ababf5;">digits strip</span> being affected each one by a <span style="color:#ababf5;">scale factor</span> that depend on the position that holds in the strip.

Â¿How many <span style="color:orange;">bits are needed for representing m values</span>?

$Log_2(n)$ by excess, for representing 35 values, 6 bits are needed. 

The <span style="color:orange;">Maximum value representable</span>, Taking into account that starts in 0, the maximum representable number is $2^n -1$
