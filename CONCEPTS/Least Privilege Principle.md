The **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)** is a security concept that is mainly centered in granting users, applications, or systems only the minimum access rights and permissions needed to perform the required tasks. 

By restricting access to the least necessary premisions, PoLP minimizes the risk of accidental or intentional misuse of resources and reduces the potential impact of security breaches.

PoLP is especially important in environments like cloud computing, IT infrastructure, and application development, where over-privileged access can lead to significant vulnerabilities.
