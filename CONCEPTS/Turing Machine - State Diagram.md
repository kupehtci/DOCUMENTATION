#CONCEPTS 

Also a Turing Machine can be defined as a <span style="color:#ababf5;">state machine</span>. 

For completing a state diagram: 
* Each <span style="color:#ababf5;">node</span> of the diagram is a state 
* Each transition to another node is defined by the symbol and strip movement of the action performed
* If a state acts as a end state, mark it as the acceptance node of the diagram.

The resulting diagram if all <span style="color:orange;">state table</span> has an action defined for each symbol that can be accepted by the Turing Machine language, the resultant diagram would be a <span style="color:#ababf5;">finite deterministic</span> one.
