# IMMUTABILITY

Immutability in IT or Software means that something once is created, cannot be changed in place.
Any change, produces a new version while the original remains intact. 

Immutability is the core when the data needs to remain intact for auditability and predictability. 

## WORM Immutability

WORM immutability or Write Once, Read Many means that dat is written a single time and then cannot be altered or deleted for a defined retention period but can be read as many times as wanted during that time. 

This protects the data agains tampering.
