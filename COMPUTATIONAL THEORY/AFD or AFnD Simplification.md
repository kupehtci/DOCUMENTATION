An automaton is a simplification of other one if has less states but both accept the same language. 

The simplification consist in:

1. Find the pairs of equivalent states. 
2. Delete one from the pair and redirect the transitions from the deleted one

In a DFA, two or more states are equivalent is taken both, the language accepted by either of them is the same. 

Two _incompatible_ states are when one of them is an aceptation one and the other dont. They cannot be compared in terms of simplification.
