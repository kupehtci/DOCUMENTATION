To be able to confirm that two AFD are equivalent, its needed to make sure that all word are _accepted_ by each of them and viceversa and either the rejected ones

#### MOORE THEOREM 

Algorithm based on testing states to know if they are equivalent. 
It makes sure because of the notion of compatibility between states, also if the number of keyword are generated is infinite. 

Two states are compatible if two of them are
