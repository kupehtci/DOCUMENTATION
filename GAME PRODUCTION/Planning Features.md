#GAMEPRODUCTION 


For each feature of the game, we can decide some parts in the planification: 

DEVELOPMENT PHASE: 
* Inception
* Implementation
* Polishing

And each of this phases has a status: 

* Not started
* On development
* Completed
* On hold
* Blocked

You can then distribute the persons-month value for each one of the features:

Each block represent the work of 1 person per 1 month. 


And then this planing can be distributed along the time taking into consideration the personal that we dispose of:
