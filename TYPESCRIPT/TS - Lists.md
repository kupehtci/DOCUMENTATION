# TypeScript - Lists

**Lists** in TypeScript or Arrays hold a set of ordered elements supporting indexing and other methods from JavaScript like `push`, `pop`, `map`, `filter` and `reduce` to work with them. 

As a difference with JavaScript, all the items in an array are typed, so all the elements in the set has the same type.
