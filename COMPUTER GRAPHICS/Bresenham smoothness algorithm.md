### BRESENHAM SMOOTHNESS ALGORITHM

Bresenham is a line drawing algorithm to smooth this line and make it representable in a pixel matrix like a screen or a grid. 

This algorithm determines the points in a n-dimensional raster [[]]that need to be selected in order to represent a <span style="color:orange;">straight line</span>. 

Can also be used for smoothing paths in pathfinding : [[Pathfinding]]. 

$f(x) = y = .5x +1$
$f(x, y) = x - 2y +2$
