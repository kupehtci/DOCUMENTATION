# Compatibility

The **compatibility** in terms of software development is the capacity of an information system, application or component to work in multiple devices, platforms, environments and operating systems. 

The compatibility can be measured with two different attributes: 
* **Coexistence**: the measurement on which the software can work efficiently sharing content with other software without impact. Both softwares need to coexist in the same environment sharing resources. 
* **Interoperability**: the grade of data exchange with other systems and use the exchanged data.
