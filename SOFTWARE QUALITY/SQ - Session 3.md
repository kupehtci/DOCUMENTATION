Section 1.4. SQ Activities:

Activities that aim minimizing the defects, the failures and the impact of failures on end-users. 
3 ways to do it:

- Preventing the defects (e.g. training, code review, etc.)
- Removing the defects (e.g. by testing)
- Minimizing the impact of defects for end-users:
    - Fault Tolerance (e.g. server redundancy)
    - Failure Containment (e.g. crash recovery)

  
Good and Bad Quality costs:

- The cost of Bad Quality is related to obvious things such as fixing problems but not so obvious ones as handling returns, warranties, brand reputation, etc.
- The cost of Good Quality is basically all the cost QA Activities require.
- Spending a lot of money in order to have the best possible quality might not be the best possible option from a pure economic point of view. Typically, the best way to optimize the cost of Quality is looking for the minimal value of the sum of the costs of bad and good quality.
- With respect to the cost of fixing a problem, we learnt that the later we fix a problem, the more expensive it’s going to be. The cheapest way to remove defects is preventing them: “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure”


**Section 1.6:** We’ve also learned what is SQE (**Software Quality Engineering) how** SQ Activities should be used during a software project.

- PLAN: Decide which activities.
- EXECUTE: Carry-out the activities.
- ANALYSE: Asses the result of the execution.

SQ Activities are not sequential: Plan everything then Execute Everything and Assess everything.

**QIP (Quality Improvement Process): After the analysis of** the QA Activities results we can decide to introduce changes in our way of working and plan the next iterations in different ways.

**Section 1.7:** The last thing we learnt is that Quality and Quality activities are not something decoupled from the rest of software development attributes. You must integrate QA activities with development activities in the same way you cannot add quality on top a product (it should be part of the product).
