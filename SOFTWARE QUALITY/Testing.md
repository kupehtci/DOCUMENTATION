### TESTING 

Testing is not to prevent bugs, testing is intended to observe deviations from expected behaviors. 

We execute tests from the point of view of the user. 

Testing is the <span style="color:MediumSlateBlue;">execution</span> of code and <span style="color:MediumSlateBlue;">observation</span> of its behavior. Evaluated by exploration and experimentation. 
Is used to <span style="color:MediumSlateBlue;">detect failures</span> and <span style="color:MediumSlateBlue;">fix</span> the linked defects. Also helps to take management decisions and reduce risks. 

If a failure is observed, we can identify the reason (bug) of that failure and remove it. 

Is a <span style="color:orange;">skeptical process</span>: the core of testing is to believe in the existence of trouble and to seek it

But testing have some limitations: 

* We <span style="color:cyan;">cannot test everything</span>. Testing is a __sampling technique__
* Testing involves learning 
* Testing don't determine that is release time. 
* Testing intend to remove risk when releasing but cannot totally remove it. 

A <span style="color:orange;">regression</span> in software is a feature that was working in previous versions but now don't. 
#### TESTING TYPES

There are infinite types of testing but the more importants are: 

Depending on item tested: 
* Unit testing
* Component testing
* System testing 
* integration testing
* E2E testing

Depending on when to decide to stop testing: 

* Coverage based testing
* Usage based testing

Depending on the **purpose**: 

* **Smoke testing**: quick test to check if a functionality is working. 
* **Regression testing**: 
* **Certification testing** 

Depending on what need to be tested: 

* Functional testing
* Structural testing

Performance relative tests: 

* Scalability tests
* Stress tests
* High avaliability tests: check if the system keeps working if some instances fail.
