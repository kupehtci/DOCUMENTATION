#ML 

Its an application of Artificial Intelligence wich objetive is to develop techniques that allows a program to learn from existing data to predict a result. 
### Types of machine learnining

There are three main types: 

`Supervised learning`

Learning about a classified (labeled) dataset to be able to make future predictions. Classification algorithms that can predict a certain label for a prediction and regression that predict a value. 

`Non supervised learning`

Main non-supervised methods are <span style="color:orange;">clustering methods</span>


`Reinforcement learning`





### METHODOLOGY

`Business Understanding`

Context comprehension, define the KPI's and important metrics and the posterior metrics evaluation. 

`Data Understanding`

Analyze the sources of the data and make an exploration in the data like correlations, detection of outliers and more. 

`Data Preparation`

Involves cleaning the data and prepare the different sets (test, evaluation)

`Modeling`

Design and development of the machine learning models

`Evaluation`

Evaluate the models towards the defined KPI's and related metrics

`Deployment`

Deploy and start using the model
