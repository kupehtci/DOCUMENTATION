# cmdlet

A **cmdlet** (Or command-let) is a lightweight command implemented in the windows PowerShell ([[PowerShell]]) that are implemented as .Net classes and compiled into DLL files making them a small executable. 

Each cmdlet follows an naming convention **Verb-Noun** that makes it intuitive as each cmdlet name is the verb indicating the action followed by description. 
Examples: `Get-ChildItems`, `Set-Location` or `Copy-Item`.
