# Ansible - Modules

A **Module** in ansible is a piece of code that allows to perform a certain task on a managed node.
Every task in a playbook calls a module. 

This component is a standalone script that is transferred to the managed host and executed using the given parameters and then removed. Once it has been executed returns a JSON result to Ansible Management System with information about the execution.
