# Azure DevOps - Build Validation Policy

A **Build Validation Policy** is a branch that indicates that an specific build pipeline must run and return success before a pull request can be completed and merge the code into the destination branch. 

Its used to integrate code changes like tests, compilation and SonarQube ([[SonarQube]]) analysis to validate if the code is correct for merging.
