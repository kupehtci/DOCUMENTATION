CI/CD Pipelines are a fundamental component of Gitlab CD/CI integration. This pipelines of steps that are executed one after another, are defined in a YAML file using the common key-value pairs of a file of this extension. 

A gitlab pipeline needs to be defined in a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the root directory of the repository.
