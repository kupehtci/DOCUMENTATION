# React Skeleton

An **skeleton** is a UI pattern or format to use as Fallback[^1] content inside a Suspense component. 
This **skeleton** needs to be a lightweight placeholder that mimics the same structure as the loading context resultant: 
* Its normally a gray box where images or text should appear. 

This technique enhances the UX, as user is alerted that some content is loading in the application and to place attention into it until it appears. 



[^1]: fallback is the element loaded in `<Suspense>` component in React that is rendered until the main component is loaded. [[React - Suspense]]
