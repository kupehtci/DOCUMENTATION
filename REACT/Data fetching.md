# React - Data fetching

Data fetching in SPAs using React is nowadays handled with TanStack Query, know as React Query as it handles the caching, refetching, race conditions, background updates and more complex patterns. 

It uses `useQuery` hook to fetch and cache the data using a query. Also offers fields like `data`, `error`, `isLoading`, `isError` and `refetch` so the UI can respond to the query state and act accordingly.
