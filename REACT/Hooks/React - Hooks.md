# React - Hooks

A **hook** in react allows a function to have access to an state and other features of React without using `React Classes`. 

The hooks in order to be used need to be imported from `'react'` like `import { useState } from 'react'`. 

Take into account that: 
* Hooks can only be called inside React `function` components and at the top level.
* Cannot be conditional or within an `if` statement. 

There are several react `hooks`: 

* `useState` allows to tract an state in a function component. 
	* state is referred to data or properties that can be tracked along the application runtime. 
* `useEffect` allows to execute side effects on each render on in a controlled way in the component. 
* `useContext` allows to manage the context, a global state of the application to share data between components. 
* `useRef`
* `useReducer`
* `useCallback`
* `useMemo`
* Custom Hooks
