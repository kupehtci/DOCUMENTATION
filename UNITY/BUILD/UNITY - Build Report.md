#UNITY #CSHARP 

UNITY has a system of callbacks implemented for getting called after, during or before the <span style="color:#aff5aa">Build pipeline</span>. 

This Preprocessor generates a <span style="color:MediumSpringGreen;">BuildReport</span>. 

This BuildReport gives information about the UNITY build process
Can be used to discover information about the files output, the build steps taken, and other platform-specific information such as native code stripping.
