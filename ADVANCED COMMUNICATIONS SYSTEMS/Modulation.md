### Modulation

Modulation is the process of varying one or more properties of a periodic waveform. 

We can translate a signal into a new bandwidth like for example to transmit a signal in WIFI (2.4GHz) by multiplying it by a carrier. 

Modulation is to convert from a digital or analogical signal into an analogical signal. 


### Analog modulation methods

* Amplitude modulation (AM) (here the amplitude of the carrier signal is varied in accordance with the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal)
	* Double-sideband modulation (DSB)
		* Double-sideband modulation with carrier (DSB-WC) (used on the AM radio broadcasting band)
		* Double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission (DSB-SC)
		* Double-sideband reduced carrier transmission (DSB-RC)
* Single-sideband modulation (SSB, or SSB-AM)
	* Single-sideband modulation with carrier (SSB-WC)
	* Single-sideband modulation suppressed carrier modulation (SSB-SC)
* Vestigial sideband modulation (VSB, or VSB-AM)
* Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)

* Frequency modulation (FM) (here the frequency of the carrier signal is varied in accordance with the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal)
* Phase modulation (PM) (here the phase shift of the carrier signal is varied in accordance with the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal)
* Transpositional Modulation (TM), in which the waveform inflection is modified resulting in a signal where each quarter cycle is transposed in the modulation process. TM is a pseudo-analog modulation (AM). Where an AM carrier also carries a phase variable phase f(ǿ). TM is f(AM,ǿ)
