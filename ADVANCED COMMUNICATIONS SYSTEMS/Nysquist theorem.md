# Nysquist theorem

Nysquist theorem is centered in signal sampling and stablished a superior limit of transmission rate of data in a noise-less transmission channel. 

The real capacity of a channel is related to the noise, the interferences and the physical characteristics of the media channel. 

Following the Nysquist's capacity theorem, if we want to transmit the double of data in a frame of time, its enough by duplicate the bandwidth
