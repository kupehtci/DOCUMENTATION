# Coding and decodings

Coding and decoding uses a type of transmission of source signals known as Transmission in Base Band. 

The signal is transmited in the same way. 

There are various ways of coding and decoding data: 

Digital to Analogical: 
* ASK: Amplitude modulation (Amplitude Shift Keying)
* FSK: Frequency modulation (Frequency  Shift Keying)
* PSK: Phase modulation (Phase Shift Keying)
* QAM: Quadrature Amplitude modulation its a combination of at least two phase changes and two amplitude changes so can at least have 4 states or 4 of depth of information sent.

Also known as BASK, BFSK and BPSK (Binary-) and with a number as prefix that indicates the number of possible values that can be represented or states that signal has. 

Analogical to digital: 
* AM: Amplitude Modulation
* FM: Frequency Modulation
* PM: Phase Modulation
