#TERRAFORM 

The most common terraform gitignore is to avoid upload the current state of the project, because this is generated by the `terraform init` command: 

```txt
.terraform
terraform.tfstate
terraform.tfstate.backup
```


`terraform.tfstate` stores the state about the managed infrastructure and its configuration. 
Its used to map real world resources to the configuration, keep track of the metadata and improve large infrastructures. 

Its important that this file is not uploaded to git, only stored in HCP Terraform or other backend to version, encrypt and  share between the team.
