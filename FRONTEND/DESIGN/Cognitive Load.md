# Frontend Design - Cognitive Load

**Cognitive load** is the amount of mental effort that the working memory uses to process information or to perform a task at a given moment. 

In website design, it refers to the mental effort the users need to navigate, understand and complete tasks or workflows on a website. 

When the <span style="color:Crimson;">cognitive load is too high</span> users normally experiences frustration, makes more errors, abandon the tasks and leave the site quickly. 

## How to reduce Cognitive Load

The cognitive load is related with the **decision fatigue** that can be caused by many options, low time-on-page, frustration when searching options and similar things. 


Its normally caused by: 
* **Visual clutter** caused by so many similar elements, redundant links, too many images or elements that are irrelevant, not clear icons and inconsistent typography. 
* **Poor architecture**: inconsistent structure between pages and lack of a clear visual hierarchy forces the user to expend extra mental effort searching for the correct options. 
* **Memory demands**: if the user needs to memoize information from previous steps or screens, increases the cognitive workload. 
* **Many choices**: showing excessive options and click ons in the same screen create fatigue in the users. 

In order to reduce the cognitive load: 
* **Simplify the interface**: 
	* Maintain a **similar typography** and iconography
	* Use **clear icons** that are more understandable than reading text. 
	* Use **similar patterns** between web pages. 
	* Use same **color palette**
* **Use a clear visual hierarchy**: use the size, weight, contrast and spacing to guide de user attention to the most important elements. 
* **Progressive disclosure**: show only the essential information and reveal only the advanced settings, details or options when the user needs them. 
	* Use collapsible sections
* **Simplify user-paths**: 
	* Avoid unnecessary steps, clicks or forms, using smart default. 
		* Make workflows shorter. (Remember Amazon auto-buy)
		* Auto-fill forms with user data. 
* **Memory aids**: 
	* Extra features to avoid extra cognitive cost like suggestions, display recent actions or history. 
		* Save user preferences like language, layout or business related like shipping information. 
* **Familiar design patterns**: 
	* dont reinvent the wheel, the brain retains mental models that are easy to travel to by reusing common navigation structures and standard layouts  so user can predict the interactions from the ones learned from other websites.
