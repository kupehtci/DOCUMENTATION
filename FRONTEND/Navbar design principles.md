# Navbar Design principles

The main principles to design a good and responsive navbar ([[Navbar]]) are: 
* **Simplicity and clarity**: 
	* limit the items to a set of limited options (5 or 7) to avoid overwhelming the user. 
	* In case that more options need to be available, group and collapse them into menus or sections. 
	* Use clear and common labels like "Home", "About", "Contact" rather than creative ones, this allow users to be familiar between different websites. 
* **Visual hierarchy and structure**: 
	* Separate primary navigation links from secondary (Action oriented links (login / search)) using colors, font-heigh or placement. 
	* Maintain a consistency of the navbar across all pages (Normally the same navigation is used). 
* **Intuitive interaction and recognition**: 
	* In case of drop-down submenus, indicate them with visual cues (Like small downward arrow that changes when open ) so the user knows that additional options are available under that section. 
	* Place the navbar in <span style="color:DodgerBlue;">expected locations</span> like on the top or left side to reduce **cognitive load** [^1]
[^1]: cognitive load is the amount of fatigue that a website causes in the user that can force the user to quit the workflow or can cause fatigue worsen the user experience [[Cognitive Load]]
