# Dropdown

A **dropdown** is a user interface component that shows a list of options or items when the user interacts with it by hovering or clicking on a visible label, field or button. 

A dropdown stays collapsed most of the time, showing the label until the user interacts and it **expands** to show the list. 

Its normally used in: 
* **Forms**: displaying a set of options in a `<select>` with `<option>` elements. 
* **Navigation**: website menus with multiple options related to a main topic or workflow. 
* **Settings**: displaying a set of configurations that can be done over the webpage under a *Settings* label to choose mode, theme or other configuration parameters.
