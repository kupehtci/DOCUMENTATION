# JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

**JRE** or **Java Runtime Environment** is a package that provides the minimal components to execute and run a Java application. 
Its a software layer that provides Java specific resources required by the Java programs to run. 

The JRE is composed of: 
* **Java Virtual Machine or JVM**: core components that interpret the application into machine-specific code. 
* **Java Class Libraries**: a collection of modules with standard functions for Os related tasks like UI, networking and I/O. 
* **Java Class Loader**: dynamically loads the classes needed to run the Java program. 

# JDK (Java Development Kit)

**JDK** or **Java Development Kit** is an SDK [^1] that has all the tools, executables and binaries needed to develop, compile, debug and run Java programs. 
Its platform restricted, so need to be installed per OS and machine. 

JDK contains JRE plus development tools like the compiler and debugger. 

# Differences
