Google Cloud offers a diverse set of compute services designed handle a wide range of applications and management needs. 

It offers the main keys from a Cloud Provider: 

* <span style="color:DodgerBlue;">On demand self service</span>: no human intervention is needed to create and manage resources. 
* <span style="color:DodgerBlue;">Broad network access</span>: you can access your cloud from anywhere
* <span style="color:DodgerBlue;">Resource pooling</span>: provides shared resources to customers
* <span style="color:DodgerBlue;">Rapid Elasticity</span>: Get more resources as quickly as needed. 
* <span style="color:DodgerBlue;">Measured service</span>: Pay for what you consume. 

You also have two different provision methods: 

* <span style="color:MediumSlateBlue;">Virtualized</span>: user configured infrastructure and maintained. 
* <span style="color:LightSeaGreen;">Serverless</span>[^2]: fully automated infrastructure for running apps within it. 


[^2]: Serverless managed infrastructures are infrastructures where you deploy the application and don't need to take care about the resources to run it, its fully managed and automated by a provider [[Serverless]]
