* <span style="color:DodgerBlue;">Broad network access</span>: you can access your cloud from anywhere
* <span style="color:DodgerBlue;">Resource pooling</span>: provides shared resources to customers
* <span style="color:DodgerBlue;">Rapid Elasticity</span>: Get more resources as quickly as needed.
