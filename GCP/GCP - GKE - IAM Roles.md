# GCP GKE IAM Roles

This is a list of predefined roles that can grant access to specific resources around the Google Kubernetes Engine[^1]. 

* `roles/container.admin` provides full access
* `roles/container.clusterAdmin` Access to the management of the cluster
* `roles/container.clusterViewer` access to get and list the GKE clusters
* `roles/container.defaultNodeServiceAccount` privileged role to use as default service account 
* `roles/container.developer`: Provides access to Kubernetes API objects inside the clusters
* `roles/container.hostServiceAgentUser`: allows Kubernetes Engine Service account to configure network resources and inspect firewall
* `roles/container.viewer`: provides read-only access to Kubernetes resources. 
- `roles/container.nodeAdmin`: Grants management of the nodes in a GKE cluster like upgrading, draining the nodes and deleting.
- `roles/container.nodeViewer`: Grants read-only access to GKE nodes. Users with this role can view the details of the nodes running in a cluster but cannot modify them.
    
- **`roles/container.securityAdmin`**: Grants permissions to manage security-related configurations in GKE, such as managing network policies, security policies, and role-based access control (RBAC) within the cluster.
    
- **`roles/container.serviceAgent`**: A service agent role required by GKE to interact with other Google Cloud services. It allows GKE to manage resources like storage buckets, load balancers, and persistent disks on behalf of the cluster.
    
- **`roles/container.adminViewer`**: Grants a combination of admin and viewer permissions, where users can view but not modify cluster and workload configurations.
    
- **`roles/container.supportViewer`**: A specialized role providing access to view support-relevant information and metrics for clusters, useful for troubleshooting and support purposes.
    
- **`roles/container.backupAdmin`**: Grants full permissions to manage backups for GKE clusters, including the ability to create, list, delete, and restore backups.
    
- **`roles/container.monitoringAdmin`**: Grants permissions to view and manage GKE monitoring configurations, including interacting with metrics, setting up alerts, and managing logs within the context of a GKE cluster.
    
- **`roles/container.loggingViewer`**: Grants read-only access to GKE logs and logging configurations, enabling users to inspect logs generated by applications and cluster components.
    
- **`roles/container.engineer`**: Grants a mid-level set of permissions for developing and operating workloads in GKE, including the ability to deploy and manage Kubernetes resources.
