#CPP 

### Regions

Because CLion is based in IntelliJ IDEA and supports multiple ways of making code regions. 

This regions are used to fold the code to helps the visualization of the code and hide certain sections.

```cpp
//region Description
//endregion
```
And also using `<editor-fold>`: 

```cpp
//<editor-fold desc="Description">
//</editor-fold>
```
