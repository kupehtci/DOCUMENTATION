#VSCODE 

# Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a cross-platform source code editor that combines a simple code editor with development features lke IntelliSense, debugging and built-in Git version control. 

Also as a light editor, can be complimented with **extensions** that improve and add functionalities. 


## Versus an IDE

VSCode is a **code editor** as it cannot compile, nor debug anything by itself without extensions. 
In comparison with an IDE or Integrated Development Environment, that brings compiler or interpreter, debugger, build tools, test and deployment tooling, VSCode depends on extensions to do all of this tasks. å
