There is a unicode character in representation of different spaces

<p>This is a &nbsp; regular space.</p>
<p>This is a &ensp; two spaces gap.</p>
<p>This is a &emsp; four spaces gap.</p>

```html
<body>
    <p>This is a &nbsp; regular space.</p>
    <p>This is a &ensp; two spaces gap.</p>
    <p>This is a &emsp; four spaces gap.</p>
