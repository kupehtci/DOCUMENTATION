## Linking files 

To link files can be done in the ```<head>``` section or can be done in the ```<body>```section but its recommended to be done in the head section. 

For linking files of css and make them apply into the webpage use the ```<link>``` tag. 

```HTML 
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="./style/style.css">
```

The ```rel``` parameters specify the type of file linked. 
The ```href``` parameter indicated the url to go through to find the requested file. 
Using relative paths starting by ./ the folder will be inside style directory and its called style.css

You can take a look of how its implemented in a basic structure of a web:
