#AWS 


Elements and resources within AWS can communicate using a buffer system in order to transmit data between them. 

When two resources work together using this messaging system, they are considered to be highly coupled. 

##### MONOLITH APPLICATIONS 

An architecture with tightly coupled components can be called a <span style="color:orange;">Monoloth application</span>. This type of application can be vulnerable if one of the components fails. 

### MICROSERVICES 

Instead the application can be configured as microservices where the service keep running if one of them fails. 

The microservices architectures can communicate between each other but are not coupled so can run independently.
