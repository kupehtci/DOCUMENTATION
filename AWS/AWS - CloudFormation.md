# AWS CloudFormation

CloudFormation is an IaC (Infrastructure as Code) service that let you define and provision AWS infrastructure as code using JSON or YAML templates

It lets you create templates that define AWS services as you want and deploy them into the AWS cloud to create the resources. 

It helps handling dependencies in an easier way.
