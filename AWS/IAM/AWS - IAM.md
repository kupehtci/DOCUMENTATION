### AWS IAM

IAM is an AWS web service that helps you to securely grant access control to AWS resources. 

Use the IAM to control who is authenticated (Sign in) and authorized (has permissions) to use some resources. 



##### IAM Availability

IAM service like other AWS Services is eventually consistent, meaning that has a high availability by replicating the data between multiple servers but changes can last a bit to be replicated. 

[^1]: ARN or Amazon Resource Name is an unique identifier that references a resource in AWS.
