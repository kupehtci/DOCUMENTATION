# AWS Serverless

AWS EC2[^ec2] provides virtual server instances where you need to provision virtual server instances, deploy the code and maintain the server instances. 

Serverless is the solution where you don't need to manage the servers, only focus in the code and applications running within it. 

For example, AWS Lambda[^lambda] is a serverless compute instance that works without managing its server.
