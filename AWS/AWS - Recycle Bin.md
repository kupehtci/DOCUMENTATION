# AWS Recycle Bin

**AWS Recycle Bin** is a fully managed solution in AWS cloud that prevent **critical AWS resources** from accidental deletion by retaining the resources for a certain time before permanent deletion. 

It works similar to a recycle bin in a local computer. 

If a resource is deleted and it maches a <span style="color:DodgerBlue">retention rule</span> that can be like tag-based retention, it is retained in the recycled bin for a certain time.


No need to change IAM roles / permissions over resources in order to block / prevent deletion of certain resources.
