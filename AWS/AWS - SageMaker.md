# AWS - SageMaker

AWS SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning (ML) service that helps developers and data scientists: 

* Build ML models
* Train ML models
* Deploy ML models into production.

Models are built using Jupyter notebooks for writing the ML code and have prebuilt algorithms and frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet and Scikit-learn. 

AWS automatically provision and manages the compute layer (CPU and GPU) and can do distributed learning on large datasets. 

### Exam questions

Example question in the exam: 

```txt
An ecommerce company wants to use machine learning (ML) algorithms to build and train models. The company will use the models to visualize complex scenarios and to detect trends in customer data. The architecture team wants to integrate its ML models with a reporting platform to analyze the augmented data and use the data directly in its business intelligence dashboards.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
* A. Use Amazon SageMaker to build and train models. Use Amazon QuickSight to visualize the data.
* B. Use Amazon QuickSight to build and train models by using calculated fields. Use Amazon QuickSight to visualize the data.
* C. Use a pre-built ML Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the AWS Marketplace to build and train models. Use Amazon OpenSearch Service to visualize the data.
* D. Use AWS Glue to create an ML transform to build and train models. Use Amazon OpenSearch Service to visualize the data.
