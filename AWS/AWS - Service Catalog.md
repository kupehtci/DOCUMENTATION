# AWS - Service Catalog

**AWS Service Catalog** is a fully managed service that allow organizations to create, manage and centrally govern a catalog of IT services within AWS that are approved to use in the company. 

Its normally used to give developers a self-service portal to deploy resources without giving them full AWS permissions, ensuring the type of services that they can deploy and the characteristics of each one of them. 

You can define within the catalog services like:  
* EC2 instances (Defining the AMI)
* RDS/Aurora databases. 
* VPC Configurations
* Lambda-based functions
* Multi-tier architectures
* Any CloudFormation-based application.
