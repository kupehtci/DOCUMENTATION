### AWS IAM

IAM is an AWS web service that helps you to securely grant access control to AWS resources. 

Use the IAM to control who is authenticated (Sign in) and authorized (has permissions) to use some resources. 

This helps to grant, manage and restrict user or other identities granular access and permissions to certain resources.


To allow IAM Users to create or modify the resources and perform certain tasks: 

* Choose or create IAM policies that define the permissions to access specific resources
* Attach the policies to the IAM user, groups or roles. 

Most users can have more multiple policies.
