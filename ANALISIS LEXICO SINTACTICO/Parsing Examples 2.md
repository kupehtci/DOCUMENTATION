### PARSING EXAMPLES 2

Consider the following grammar: 

|       | Production rule | FIRST   | FOLOW         |
| ----- | --------------- | ------- | ------------- |
| 1     | E → TE'         | {id, (} | {$, )}        |
| 2 - 3 | E'→ +TE' l ε    | {+, ε}  | {$, )}        |
| 4     | T → FT'         | {id, (} | {+, $, )}     |
| 5 - 6 | T' → \*FT' \| ε | {\*, ε} | {+, $, )}     |
| 7 - 8 | F → id I (E)    | {id, (} | {\*, +, $, )} |
* FOLLOW(T) = FOLLOW(E) (Because E' can be ε)

|     | id  | (   | )   | +   | *   | $   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E   | 1   | 1   |     |     |     |     |
| E'  |     |     | 3   | 2   |     | 3   |
| T   | 4   | 4   |     |     |     |     |
| T'  |     |     | 6   | 6   | 5   | 6   |
| F   | 7   | 8   |     |     |     |     |

Given the following grammar, calculate the FIRST and FOLLOW sets and the parsing table. 
```txt
S→ abA | bC 
A → CBD 
B→ cAb | ε 
C→ d | S | ε 
D→ ε

```

| FIRST | a   | b   | c   | d   | ε   |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S     | X   | X   |     |     |     |
| A     | X   | X   | X   | X   | X   |
| B     |     |     |     |     |     |
| C     |     |     |     |     |     |
| D     |     |     |     |     |     |

| FOLLOW | a   | b   | c   | d   | $   |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A      |     |     |     |     |     |
| A      |     |     |     |     |     |
| B      |     |     |     |     |     |
| C      |     |     |     |     |     |
| D      |     |     |     |     |     |

Given the following grammar, build the parsing table: 
```txt
S --> bLS'        (1)
S'--> aS' | ε     (2 - 3)
L --> SL' | a     (4 - 5)
L'--> cL | d      (6 - 7)
```

```txt
FIRST(S)  = {b}
FIRST(S') = {a, ε}
FIRST(L)  = {b, a}
FIRST(L') = {c, d}
FOLLOW(S')= {c, d} ¿?
```

|     | a   | b   | c   | d   | $   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S   |     | 1   |     |     |     |
| S'  | 2   |     |     |     |     |
| L   | 5   | 4   |     |     |     |
| L'  |     |     |     |     |     |

Check if following parsing table is correct
![[parsing_table_1.png]]

```txt
FIRST(S) = {a, b, d}
FIRST(A) = {b, d, ε}
FIRST(B) = {b, ε}
FIRST(D) = {d, ε}

FOLLOW(S) = {$}
FOLLOW(A) = {a}
FOLLOW(B) = {d, a}
FOLLOW(D) = {a}
```

B and D are the only one that need to look into their FOLLOW sets because contains ε. 
In this case in B, 4 number is placed in the table because is the production rule that imply a ε.

With the following grammar, build the AST in order to check if "bdabd" is a string generated by the grammar:
