# AZURE 

Azure is the Microsoft's cloud computing platform solution that offers a wide range of services for building, deploying and managing applications and services though the global Microsoft's network of data centers. 

It offers: 

* **Computation Resources**: It offers user managed virtual machines[^1], serverless solutions for Azure managed computation instances[^2], event driven code execution using Azure Functions[^3]. You can adapt this machines in all properties to the needed requirements for the workload. 
* **Kubernetes and containers resources**: it offers some computations solutions for Kubernetes and containers applications like Azure Kubernetes Service or AKS[^5], Azure Container instance and similar.  
* **Networking resources**: includes tools for creating virtual networks with subnets divisions[^4]
* **Security features**: like Windows Defender, Azure Active Directory (AAD) currently Entra ID, Network Security groups to restrict access between groups of resources[^6] managed by certain rules. Also the credentials and keys for authentication can be safely stored in Azure Key Vault[^7]
* **Databases**: It also provides some databases for storing unstructured and structured data like Azure SQL Database, CosmosDB (NoSQL)[^8], Azure Data Lake[^9]
* **Global infrastructure**: It provides a global infrastructure distributed between all Microsoft datacenters with High Availability. 
* **Monitoring**: analyze and monitor the application performance and other resources metrics with Azure Monitor and log analytics [^10]. 
* **AI**: AI and machine learning with Azure Machine Learning for building, training and handle Machine learning workloads or use Cognitive Services for using built-in APIs for Ai capabilities.
