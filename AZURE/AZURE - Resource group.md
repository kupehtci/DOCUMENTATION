#AZURE 


An azure resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. 

This groups can include all the resources of the solution or only the ones that you want to manage as a group. Take into account to group them by similar resources that share lifecycle and can be easily deploy or update as a group. 

The resource group can be used in the Azure Portal to create views for: 

* Metrics information about the solution (CPU, resources and similar)
* Deployments
* Policies enforced to the group
* Diagnostics
