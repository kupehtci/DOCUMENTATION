### Latex comments

In latex like other markup or coding languages, comments can be written around the code or syntax without being executed or interpreted. 
In this case and different from other languages, comments in <span style="color:#ababf5;">LaTeX</span> are started by `%`. 

```LATEX
% This is a comment
```

Can also be done with <span style="color:orange;">comment environments</span> by using <span style="color:crimson;">comment package</span>. [[LATEX - Environments]]. 

```LATEX
\usepackage{comment}
\begin{document}

\begin{comment}
This is a comment,
a multi-line comment,
indeed.
\end{comment}

\end{document}
```
