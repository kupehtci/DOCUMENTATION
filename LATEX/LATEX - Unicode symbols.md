### UNICODE SYMBOLS

You can use unicode symbols within a LaTex document easily by using [[XeTex]]. 

For using this you need to import the following packages: 
* mathletters : includes more compatibility with Unicode Mathematical symbols like Ïƒ
* utf8x: gets extra characters because is an expansion of basic utf8. Asign the inputenc option. 


```LATEX
\usepackage[mathletters]{ucs}
\usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}
```
