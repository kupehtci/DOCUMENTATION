#DATABASES 

### NO-SQL DATABASES

Are databases that store data in a format other than relational tables. 

It allows to have different schema for same data instances, so have a <span style="color:orange;">flexible schema</span>. 
This allows the database to be easily adapted in order to waterfall project planifications. 

Also they provide more <span style="color:orange;">scalability</span> because are designed to scale horizontally using **distributed clusters**. 

Have <span style="color:IndianRed;">high performance</span> compared to SQL databases because are optimized for data models or specific data access patterns. 

Can store multiple variable data types because of their <span style="color:DodgerBlue;">high functionality</span> of having strong APIs for data manage and more data types. 

Also can be distributed between distributed structures of data replicated, allowing a <span style="color:MediumSlateBlue;">high availiability</span>. 

### ðŸ“ˆ PROS

* <span style="color:Salmon;">Flexibility</span>
	Easily to adapt to a project more than Entity-Relationship models

* <span style="color:Salmon;">Horizontal Scalability</span>
	Scale in number of servers, not in server consumption

* <span style="color:Salmon;">Performance</span>:
	Supports <span style="color:IndianRed;">query optimization</span> for large amounts of data. 

* <span style="color:Salmon;">High availability</span>: 
	Support distributed structures with data replicated. This replication minimizes latency. 

### ðŸ“‰ DRAWBACKS

* <span style="color:Salmon;">Non-Compatibility with SQL</span>: 
	No-SQL databases has their own characteristics and not are always compatible with relational databases. 

* <span style="color:Salmon;">Lack of estandarization</span>
	There are so many NO-SQLs technologies and each one has their own usage. 
	
* <span style="color:Salmon;">Multiplatform support</span>
	Most of No-SQL databases are only prepared for Linux, not being multiplatform. 

* <span style="color:Salmon;">Eventual consistency</span>
	No all NoSQL consider atomicity and integrity of the data. 

* <span style="color:Salmon;">Access control</span>
	Different views [^views] or different access capabilities can not easily or even restricted in different no-SQL technologies. 
 
### IMPORTANT TYPES

There are 4 forms of storing No-SQL data: 

* Document `MongoDB`
	Data is stored as semi-structured documents, such as XML or JSON and can be queried as this
	
* Key-Value `Redis` and `DynamoDB`
	The data is stored as <span style="color:IndianRed;">tuples</span> or Key and a value, optimized for sim. le and fast read operations

* Wide-Column `Cassandra` and `HBase`
	Stored data as columns families and each one of them is considered as an entity. Optimized for large amount of data. 
	
* Graph `Neo4j` and `Memgraph`
	Stores data as nodes and edges and can handle easily complex relationships between data.
