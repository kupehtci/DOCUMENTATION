* <span style="color:DodgerBlue;">Value</span>: Relevant data
* <span style="color:DodgerBlue;">Variety</span>: Heterogeneous and unstructured data sources
* <span style="color:DodgerBlue;">Velocity</span>: high speed processing in order to critical decision support
* <span style="color:DodgerBlue;">Veracity</span>: data quality is unreliable but comes from uncontrolled environments. 
* <span style="color:DodgerBlue;">Variability</span>: data is not always the same in the same context

### Technologies

There are also various technologies for different purposes within Big Data: 

* <span style="color:DodgerBlue;">Storage</span>: MongoDB, Redis, Hadoop and other lets process huge volume of data
* <span style="color:DodgerBlue;">Analytics</span>: spark is an engine for processing big data by unifying various modules for streaming, querying and graph processing. 
* <span style="color:DodgerBlue;">Data mining</span>: Presto is a SQL query engine used for running interactive queries in ranges of Gigabytes to petabytes. 
* <span style="color:DodgerBlue;">Visualization</span>: Tableau is a powerful data visualization tool used in BI[^3] industry, plotly for creating graphs. 

### Why real time analytic processing? 

We are all consuming and generating data. 
While requesting data we are also generating data that companies can use in real time to analyze, summarize and visualize knowledge in order to use it.
