#CONCEPTS #DATABASES 

### Database design process

Through certain steps: 

1. Collect requirements: Determine certain properties and items that are required in the database.  
2. Design the logic of database: through Entity-Relationship diagrams[^1] or Relational Models[^2] or even class models of UML. 
3. Design the physical database: depends of the database management system (e.g. Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, mariaDB, ...). Describe the complete details of data structure and access paths. Reflects the changes of the data structure from the *ER Diagram*.
