### OPERATIONAL vs INFORMATIONAL Systems

<span style="color:MediumSlateBlue;">Operational systems</span> are used to store data for support some functions. Maintains the data in order to be displayed within a system. 

In contrast, <span style="color:orange;">informational systems</span> store data in order to make future decisions. This data is analyzed and reported in order to plan, control and decide in future operations. 

In comparison [^1] : 

| Operational Systems                                                                          | Informational Systems                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Operational systems are designed to deal with the running values of data.                    | Informational Systems deals with the collection, compilation and deriving information from data. |
| In operational systems, optimization of data structure is done for transactions.             | In informational systems, optimization of data structure is done for complex queries.            |
| Operational systems have response time of sub-seconds.                                       | While informational systems have a response time of few seconds to minutes.                      |
| Operational systems are generally suited for small volumes of data.                          | Informational Systems are mainly designed for large volumes of data and hence convenient to use. |
| Operational systems are process oriented.                                                    | While informational systems are subject oriented.                                                |
| Operational systems supports various data access operations such as read, update and delete. | Informational systems only supports read operation for data access.                              |
