#GAME_SOUND_THEORY

A way to make a sound effect to osund away from receptor its so lower down the volume and decrease the volume and gain for medium and high frecuency to make the bass to sound. 

This is done because when the sound is far awsy the frewquency that reaches the receptor better is lower frequency ones.
