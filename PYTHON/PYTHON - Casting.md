#PYTHON 


Although python is a no typed language, have its own data types that can be casted to perform certain actions. 


#### STRING

A value can be casted to string using `str()`.
For example, string concatenation using `+` operator can only be used if all operand are strings, so if want to concatenate a numeric value, can be done with this function: 

```PYTHON
a = 10
print("a value:" + str(a)) # a value: 10
```
