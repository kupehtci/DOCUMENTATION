# PYTHON

**Python** is a high-level programming language with a legible syntax that is interpreted (not compiled): 

Its multi-paradigme, as allows OOP[^1], imperative and functional. 

This language is normally used in: 
* Web development using Django or Flask. 
* Data analysis using numPy, Pandas and Matplotlib
* AI: using TensorFlow and PyTorch. 
* Automation. 

As an interpreted language: 
* The runtime or execution is read line-by-line
* iterative development
* Less efficient than compiled languages but with low difference.
