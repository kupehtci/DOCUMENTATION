# Python - OS

**OS** is an standard library module that provides functionalities for interacting with the operating system. 
Its a portable way to work with directories, files, environmental variables, processes and other OS level features directly from Python code. 


Its part of the Python Standard Library, so its not needed to be installed independently.

It wraps many OS operations like listing directories or creating folders in a cross-platform language, so the same code perform the same operation in Windows, Linux and MacOS.
