# CVEs Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

**Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures** or **CVEs** are standardized identifiers assigned to cybersecurity vulnerabilities in software and hardware. 

A CVE its not a vulnerability itself, its a reference for a publicly known security exposure. 

When a new vulnerability is identified, its assigned a CVE ID in collaboration with researchers, vendors and CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs). 

## Usage

CVEs establish a common language for referring to vulnerabilities and support coordinate responses to threats.
