# CVSS Common Vulnerability Scoring System

CVSS or Common Vulnerability Scoring System is an industry standard used to define and communicate the severity of a vulnerability in cybersecurity. 

It defines an score ranking from 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe vulnerability that must be remediated. 

This is used together with CVE ([[CVEs Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures]]) identifiers to define a vulnerability and provide the severity. 

The system calculates the score based on some metrics based in the ease of exploitation and the impact of the vulnerability: 
* **Base metrics**: inherit characteristics like the attack vector, attack complexity, privileges required, used interaction needed and the impact in confidentiality, integrity and availability. 
* **Temporal metrics**: time sensitive factors like exploit code maturity, remediation level and the report confidence. 
* **Environmental Metrics**: allow organizations to adjust scores based in the infrastructure they have, security requirements and risk tolerance. 

By default, the **Base Metrics** are the one exposed together with the CVEs in Databases like NVD ([[NVD Database]]), providing base context for the vulnerability. 

## Standards

CVSS has evolved through the time and has be iterated to refine the standards as much as possible: 
* **CVSS v1.0**: initial version that provide the universal standard security rating. 
* **CVSS v2.0**: Reduces inconsistencies and offer more granularity and accuracy for IT vulnerabilities in different system types. 
* **CVSS v3.0**: Introduces several new metrics and formulas maintaining the 0-10 scoring. 
	* This version added textual severity ratings: 
		* None: 0
		* Low: 0.1 - 3.9
		* Medium: 4.0 - 6.9
		* High: 7.0 - 8.9
		* Critical: 9.0 - 10.0
* **CVSS v3.1:** A minor update that focused on clarifying and improving usability without introducing new metrics. 
* **CVSS v4.0**: Introduces new "attack requirements" that complements the attack complexity. 

### Interesting Facts

CVSS was created in 2005 by U.S. National Infrastructure Advisory Council to create an approach to measure IT risks.
