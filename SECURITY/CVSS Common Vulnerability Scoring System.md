# CVSS Common Vulnerability Scoring System

CVSS or Common Vulnerability Scoring System is an industry standard used to define and communicate the severity of a vulnerability in cybersecurity. 

It defines an score ranking from 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe vulnerability that must be remediated. 

This is used together with CVE ([[CVEs Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures]]) identifiers to define a vulnerability and provide the severity. 

The system calculates the score based on some metrics based in the ease of exploitation and the impact of the vulnerability: 
* **Base metrics**: inherit characteristics like the attack vector, attack complexity, privileges required, used interaction needed and the impact in confidentiality, integrity and availability. 
* **Temporal metrics**: time sensitive factors like exploit code maturity, remediation level and the report confidence. 
* **Environmental Metrics**: allow organizations to adjust scores based in the infrastructure they have, security requirements and risk tolerance. 

By default, the **Base Metrics** are the one exposed together with the CVEs in Databases like NVD ([[NVD Database]]), providing base context for the vulnerability. 

## Base Metrics

The base metrics evaluate the intrinsic characteristics of a vulnerability that are constant over the time and are same in all environments or systems. 
Base Metrics are divided in exploitability metrics and impact metrics: 

**Exploitability metrics**:
* **(AV) Attack Vector**: description about how the vulnerability can be exploited: 
	* **Network**: remotely exploitable
	* **Adjacent**: local network
	* **Physical**: requires a physical access. 
* **(AC) Attack Complexity**: measures the conditions beyond the attacker control that must exists in order to exploit the vulnerability. 
* **(AT) Attack Requirements** <span style="color:#957dad">(New in v4.0)</span> captures the deployment or configuration conditions that are required for a successful exploitation out of attacker control. 
* **(PR) Privileges Required**: indicates the level of privileges required by the attacker in order to exploit the vulnerability. (Low, Medium or High). 
* **(UI) User Interaction**: indicates if the exploit requires a certain action from an user like clicking in the UI or executing a certain program. (None or Required). 

**Impact Metrics** (None, Low or High): 
* **Confidentiality**: identifies the data that is exposed to unauthorized users. 
* **Integrity**: Degree of which the data can be modified by an attacker. 
* **Availability**: Impact on the system or the service availability. 

## Threat Metrics

The threat metrics identifies the characteristics that change over the time based on the use and exploitation of this vulnerability. In CVSS v4.0 standard, it was simplified to a single metric: 

* **(E) Exploit Maturity**: indicates the current state of the exploit techniques to attack this CVE: 
	* **Not defined**: not defined the usage of the exploit. 
	* **Attacked**: its currently and actively exploited. 
	* **POC**: Proof of Concept exists., 
	* **Unreported**: has not been reported the usage and exploit of the CVE. 

## Environmental Metrics

The environmental metrics are the ones that allow organizations to customize and vary the score based on their present infrastructure and security specifications. 
* **Modified base metrics**: organizations can adjust any base metric to their environment. 
* **Security Requirements**: confidentiality, integrity and availability requirements allow to define how critical each impact is to their components. 
* **Safety Metric**: <span style="color:#957dad">(New in v4.0)</span> to measure the potential safety impact. 

## Supplemental Metrics

<span style="color:#957dad">(New in v4.0)</span> **Supplemental Metrics** provide context related evaluation criteria that doesn't affect the rating but allow organizations to take into account additional factors into the evaluation: 
* **Automatable**: if the exploit can be automated. 
* **Recovery**: defines the component ability to recover the availability after an attack that exploites the vulnerability. 
* **Value density**: measures the density of vulnerable resources in an infrastructure that are affected by the vulnerability. 
	* Interesting in vulnerability that affects different versions of a software or a low-level software like an OS.
* **Vulnerability response effort**: measures the effort that need to be invested in solving the attack. 
* **Provider Urgency**: indicates the provider effort in remediating the vulnerability. 

## Standards

CVSS has evolved through the time and has be iterated to refine the standards as much as possible: 
* **CVSS v1.0**: initial version that provide the universal standard security rating. 
* **CVSS v2.0**: Reduces inconsistencies and offer more granularity and accuracy for IT vulnerabilities in different system types. 
* **CVSS v3.0**: Introduces several new metrics and formulas maintaining the 0-10 scoring. 
	* This version added textual severity ratings: 
		* None: 0
		* Low: 0.1 - 3.9
		* Medium: 4.0 - 6.9
		* High: 7.0 - 8.9
		* Critical: 9.0 - 10.0
* **CVSS v3.1:** A minor update that focused on clarifying and improving usability without introducing new metrics. 
* **CVSS v4.0**: Introduces new "attack requirements" that complements the attack complexity. 

### Interesting Facts

CVSS was created in 2005 by U.S. National Infrastructure Advisory Council to create an approach to measure IT risks.
