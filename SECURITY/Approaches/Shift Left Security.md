# Shift Left Security

Shift Left Security is a security approach where the security checks, requirements and testing over an application are done as early as possible in the development lifecycle instead of being done at the end pre-release. 

The main idea behind this approach is to find and fix vulnerabilities during the design,  development: 
* Security activities are integrates om the planning, design, development and build stages. 
* Developers must be envolver in security by using tools and automations (DevSecOps). 

Its one of the core **key concepts** in **DevSecOps practices**, as security assurance is inserted in all the lifecycle of the conception of the application instead of just the end. 

The advantages of implementing shift left security are: 
* **Security fixes are cheaper and faster** when the application is under development than in production phase. 
* Continuous scanning of code, dependencies and infrastructure **reduces the vulnerabilities** that reach production. 
* Threat modeling and secure design decisions leads into more **robust architectures**. 


If implemented into the DevSecOps lifecycle, the developers get a fast feedback through the automations learning more coding best practices and collaborating more efficiently.
