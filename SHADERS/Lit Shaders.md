## LIT SHADERS

The Lit Shader lets you render real-world surfaces like stone, wood, glass, plastic, and metals in photo-realistic quality. 

Your light levels and reflections look lifelike and react properly across various lighting conditions, for example bright sunlight, or a dark cave. This Shader uses the most computationally heavy [shading model](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.lightweight@5.10/manual/shading-model.html) in LWRP.
