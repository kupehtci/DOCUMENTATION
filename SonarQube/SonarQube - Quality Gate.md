# SonarQube - Quality Gate

A **SonarQube Quality Gate** is a set of conditions that determine if a project's code meets the minimum quality standards. 

Its a set of multiple conditions that measure the metrics analyzed by a **quality profile** ([[SonarQube - Quality Profile]]) and with a comparison operator < or > checks if the quality profile resulting metrics meets the expected quality standards. 

You can also create **custom quality gates** by modifying the conditions that the metrics must met.
