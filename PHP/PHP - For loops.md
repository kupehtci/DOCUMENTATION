Is lightly typed and have some certain features not avaliable in other languages. 

Take into account that using <span style="color:orange;">for loops</span> to traverse an array is not as common due to the fact that PHP arrays are not indexed as common arrays, they are like <span style="color:#d291bc;">ordered maps</span>
